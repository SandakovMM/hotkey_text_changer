# hotkey_text_changer


This python programm to make any changes with text on keystroke. 
In my work i find out that sometimes i need to change some strings to another by a certain pattern. So now, i try to make programm to do that with just one or two keystroke.

In my mind now it's must be like that:
	We have some programm called with some hotkey in OS (or maybe it's always stay alive, don't really know whats best decision). We set mapping of keys and some functions worked with strings in addition modules attached with our programm. And after that we can use our hotkeys. Function get string from clipboard change it and insert result back to clipboard.

So this is it. Seems like pretty simple task. 
Tell me if you have some questions or advice.
Thank you for attention and have a nice day!
